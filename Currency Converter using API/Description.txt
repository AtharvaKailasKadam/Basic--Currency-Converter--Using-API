ðŸ’± Currency Converter
This repository contains the source code for a Currency Converter web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The app allows users to convert values between different currencies in real-time using live exchange rates.

    1. API Used: The project uses the @fawazahmed0/currency-api â€” a fast, free,
              and open-source API that provides up-to-date exchange rates in JSON format.

ðŸŽ¨  2. AI-Powered CSS: The design and styling of the site are enhanced using TRAE AI,
                    which was used to generate creative and responsive CSS styling patterns for an engaging UI.

    3. Learning-Based Project: This project was developed by learning from online tutorials, GitHub repositories,
                            and various other web development resources.

The application is lightweight, responsive, and beginner-friendly, making it a great example of integrating APIs and
creative design into a functional tool.
